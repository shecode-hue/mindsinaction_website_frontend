        <p>Namibia hosted the first Southern Africa sub-Regional Forum on Artificial Intelligence. The event which was co-organized by UNESCO and Namibia's Ministry of Higher Education, Technology, and Innovation, took place in Windhoek, Namibia, from September 7th to 9th, 2022, with the theme "Towards a development-oriented sustainable and ethical use of artificial intelligence."
       </p>
       <p>The goal of the forum was to map the development and application of artificial intelligence in the subregion while also discussing key AI issues, challenges, and opportunities in the context of Southern Africa.
       </p>
       <p>The forum included an exhibition as well as side events where stakeholders discussed the practical applications of AI and saw presentations of AI projects developed by students from various Windhoek schools in collaboration with the Mindsinaction STEAM Center, as well as their mechanical and electrical divisions, who went to teach students about 3D printing and animation.
       </p>
       <p>Mr. Ndaudika Mulundileni, CEO of Mindsinaction, stated in an interview with Fresh FM that these side events were extremely important because they provided students with the opportunity to solve real-time Artificial Intelligence problems, acquiring new skills to apply as they continue to broaden their knowledge. Mr. Ndaudika defines AI as "the artificial emulation of human effort by machines, particularly computer systems."
       </p>
       <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the world and the future of humanity, raising extremely complex questions at the intersection of technical, ethical, political, legal, and economic considerations and interests. 
       </p>
       <p>AI will benefit future generations depending on the field in which it is used and how quickly technology advances. In the agricultural industry, for example, it is used to count and predict crop diseases through visual perception, as well as to monitor crop and vegetation. It can help the healthcare industry with clinical document classification and patient health status monitoring. One can only speculate on how much more can be accomplished if we learn more about AI, given what has already been accomplished with the little that humans have learned about it. 
       </p>
       <p>Many problems, according to Mindsinaction's IT department, can be solved using artificial intelligence. It can assist us in automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks. Many people will lose their jobs as a result of AI, but this is unavoidable. AI in movies appears sophisticated, but true AI does not exist yet; however, with a few more years, we could reach that level. 
       </p>
       <p>While new and emerging technologies such as AI have yet to be fully democratized, they are already impacting and will continue to impact our daily lives. The Forum served as a platform for streamlining global and continental debates on AI to the regional and country levels, with the goal of encouraging participating countries from the region to spark national debates toward a structured approach to AI development and use, while also ensuring the development of context-relevant policy options for its governance.
